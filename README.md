# CHIP-8 Emulator

A simple C++ implementation of [CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8).

## Description

This is a simple CHIP-8 emulator I developed as a first step towards developing more complex emulators in the future. Writing a CHIP-8 emulator is often considered a rite of passage in the emulator development community, so I wanted to write one before attempting a Gameboy emulator next. Compiles in Microsoft Visual Studio 2022.
